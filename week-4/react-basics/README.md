Try to bootstrap a basic React application using vite. 
Read more about vite here - https://vitejs.dev/

Create the following functionality - 
 - A basic TODO application where there are two input (title and description) boxes and users can add append TODOs to a div
 - Try using the same DOM functionality we did in week 4. Don't try to use state variables in React just yet
 - Just tro to port over our original HTML/JS implementation over to a React project
 - Hard todo - If you can, try using `useState` that we discussed this week and propagate the TODOs using state (If you don't understand this, don't worry about it)
